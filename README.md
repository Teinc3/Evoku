## Development
To install dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```

To launch both the game client and the game server concurrently, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The Typescript Compiler is set to noEmit, but you can still do a static type check by running:
```bash
npm run comp
```

The project adheres strictly to certain coding standards and linting rules. To check for errors, run:
```bash
npm run lint
```

To run tests for both the client and server, run:
```bash
npm run test
```

There are separate commands to launch the client and server individually:
```bash
npm run dev:client
npm run dev:server
```

Note that these separate commands also apply to other npm commands, such as start and test.
