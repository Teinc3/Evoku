# ActionEnum Type Guards Optimization

## Problem
The original ActionEnum type guard system used 10 separate `Set` objects for O(1) lookups, but this approach had several issues:
- **Memory overhead**: Each Set stored all enum values separately 
- **Hierarchical function calls**: Functions like `isActionEnum()` made multiple nested calls
- **Management complexity**: 10 separate data structures to maintain

## Solution
Replaced the Set-based approach with a **range-based optimization**:

### Key Insights
The enum values follow clear, non-overlapping numeric ranges:
- Protocol: -12 to -10
- Session: -20  
- Lobby: -53 to -50
- Lifecycle: -61 to -60
- Mechanics: -4 to -1
- Water PUP: 10-13, Fire PUP: 20-23, Wood PUP: 30-33, Metal PUP: 40-43, Earth PUP: 50-53

### Optimization Techniques
1. **Range-based checks**: Use simple numeric range comparisons instead of Set lookups
2. **Inlined range checks**: Eliminate hierarchical function calls for frequently used functions
3. **Single comprehensive checks**: Functions like `isActionEnum()` now do all range checks inline

### Performance Results
- **Original (Set-based)**: 0.000099ms per check
- **Optimized (Range-based)**: 0.000043ms per check
- **Improvement**: ~56% faster performance

### Benefits
- ✅ **Better Performance**: ~2.3x faster type guard checks
- ✅ **Less Memory Usage**: No need to store all enum values in Sets
- ✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Single range configuration vs 10 separate Sets
- ✅ **Type Safety Preserved**: All TypeScript type guards work exactly the same
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to the API

### Implementation
- Single `ACTION_RANGES` configuration object defines all ranges
- `inRange()` utility function for clean range checks
- Optimized functions use inline range checks for maximum performance
- Performance test suite validates correctness and tracks regression

This optimization addresses the issue requirements by making the code "less bloated and repetitive" while significantly "enhancing performance capabilities".
